@article{Gonzalo,
	abstract = {Kynureninase (KYNU) is a kynurenine pathway (KP) enzyme that produces metabolites with immunomodulatory properties. In recent years, overactivation of KP has been associated with poor prognosis of several types of cancer, in particular by promoting the invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance of cancer cells. However, the role of KYNU in gliomas remains to be explored. In this study, we used the available data from TCGA, CGGA and GTEx projects to analyze KYNU expression in gliomas and healthy tissue, as well as the potential contribution of KYNU in the tumor immune infiltrate. In addition, immune-related genes were screened with KYNU expression. KYNU expression correlated with the increased malignancy of astrocytic tumors. Survival analysis in primary astrocytomas showed that KYNU expression correlated with poor prognosis. Additionally, KYNU expression correlated positively with several genes related to an immunosuppressive microenvironment and with the characteristic immune tumor infiltrate. These findings indicate that KYNU could be a potential therapeutic target for modulating the tumor microenvironment and enhancing an effective antitumor immune response.},
